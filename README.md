# GistMeister

**GistMeister is a simple Gist organizer** which allows for comment editing through the use of **QR Codes**. The project is written on **Xcode 10**, utilizes **Swift 3** and some parts of **Swift 4**. The package manager I have used is no other than **CocoaPods** in which a few base libraries exist in order to facilitate development, such as **Alamofire**, **SVProgressHUD**, and **Moa**.

The source code is organized as follows:
```
+ Source
  + Models
    - GitHub User
    - GitHub Gist

  + View Controllers
    - Authentication
    - Home
    - QR Scanner
    - Gist Details & Comments
